Example 1
=========

Consider the following simple schedule:

| job number | arrival time | running time | priority |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 0          | 0            | 8            | 1        |
| 1          | 1            | 8            | 1        |
| 2          | 3            | 4            | 2        |

The flow of execution of functions calls is as follows:

```
 scheduler_start_up(cores = 1, scheme = FCFS)
     --> scheduler initialized

 scheduler_new_job(job_number = 0, time = 0, running_time = 8, priority = 1)
     --> returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run on core(id=0)

 scheduler_new_job(job_number = 1, time = 1, running_time = 8, priority = 1)
     --> returns -1, indicating that job(id=1) will not be scheduled at this time.

 scheduler_new_job(job_number = 2, time = 3, running_time = 4, priority = 2)
     --> returns -1, indicating that job(id=2) will not be scheduled at this time.

 scheduler_job_finished(core_id = 0, job_number = 0, time = 8)
     --> returns 1, indicating job(id=1) should run next on core(id=0).

 scheduler_job_finished(core_id = 0, job_number = 1, time = 16)
     --> returns 2, indicating job(id=2) should run next on core(id=0).

 scheduler_job_finished(core_id = 0, job_number = 2, time = 20)
     --> returns -1, indicating that core(id=0) should remain idle.

 scheduler_average_waiting_time()
     --> returns (20/3) == 6.67.

 scheduler_average_turnaround_time()
     --> returns (40/3) == 13.33.

 scheduler_average_response_time()
     --> returns (20/3) == 6.67.

 scheduler_clean_up()
     --> cleans up and frees all memory used by the scheduler

```
When the simulator is executed and the flow of execution is implemented correctly, you will see the following output:
