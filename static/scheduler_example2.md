Example 2
=========

Consider the following simple schedule:

| job number | arrival time | running time | priority |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 0          | 0            | 8            | 1        |
| 1          | 1            | 8            | 1        |
| 2          | 3            | 4            | 2        |

The flow of execution of functions calls is as follows:
```
 scheduler start up(cores = 2, scheme = FCFS)
     --> scheduler initialized

 new job(job number = 0, time = 0, running time = 8, priority = 1)
     --> returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run on core(id=0)

 new job(job number = 1, time = 1, running time = 8, priority = 1)
     --> returns 1, indicating that job(id=1) should run on core(id=1).

 new job(job number = 2, time = 3, running time = 4, priority = 2)
     --> returns -1, indicating that job(id=2) will not be scheduled at this time.

 job finished(core id = 0, job number = 0, time = 8)
     --> returns 2, indicating job(id=2) should run next on core(id=0).

 job finished(core id = 1, job number = 1, time = 9)
     --> returns -1, indicating that core(id=1) should remain idle.

 job finished(core id = 0, job number = 2, time = 12)
     --> returns -1, indicating that core(id=0) should remain idle.

 scheduler average waiting time()
     --> returns (5/3) == 1.67.

 scheduler average turnaround time()
     --> returns (25/3) == 8.33.

 scheduler average response time()
     --> returns (5/3) == 1.67.

 scheduler clean up()
     --> cleans up and frees all memory used by the scheduler
```
When the simulator is executed and the flow of execution is implemented correctly, you will see the following output:
