Example 3
=========

Consider the following simple schedule:

| job number | arrival time | running time | priority |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 0          | 0            | 8            | 1        |
| 1          | 1            | 8            | 1        |
| 2          | 3            | 4            | 2        |

The flow of execution of functions calls is as follows:
```
  scheduler start up(cores = 1, scheme = RR)
      --> scheduler initialized

  new job(job number = 0, time = 0, running time = 8, priority = 1)
      --> returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run on core(id=0)

  new job(job number = 1, time = 1, running time = 8, priority = 1)
      --> returns -1, indicating that job(id=1) will not be scheduled at this time.

  quantum expired(core id = 0, time = 2)
      --> returns 1, indicating job(id=1) should run next on core(id=0).

  new job(job number = 2, time = 3, running time = 4, priority = 2)
      --> returns -1, indicating that job(id=2) will not be scheduled at this time.

  quantum expired(core id = 0, time = 4)
      --> returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run next on core(id=0).

  quantum expired(core id = 0, time = 6)
      --> returns 2, indicating job(id=2) should run next on core(id=0).

  quantum expired(core id = 0, time = 8)
      --> returns 1, indicating job(id=1) should run next on core(id=0).

  ... /* jobs will continue rotating and running until all jobs finish, statistics, and then cleanup */
```

...it's important to note that even though the jobs arrive in the order `0 1 2`, the order of the jobs in your priority queue will following the rotation: `0 2 1` -> `2 1 0` -> `1 0 2` -> `0 2 1`.

When the simulator is executed and the flow of execution is implemented correctly, you will see the following output:
